                Anton was Frida's first boyfriend, and their relationship began during a pivotal time in both of their lives. Anton had just relocated from Ume√• to Gothenburg, embarking on
                a new chapter in his life as he entered the second grade in a completely unfamiliar school. The change had left him feeling extremely nervous, surrounded by the novelty of a
                new city, school, and the faces of strangers. On that nerve-wracking first day of school, Anton's life took a significant turn when he encountered Frida. She approached him
                with a warm and welcoming demeanor, introducing herself and helping him navigate the intricate web of his new classmates. Their initial interaction quickly evolved into a deep
                and enduring friendship. As they journeyed through their school years, their bond strengthened, and by the time they reached fifth grade, their relationship blossomed into a sweet romance.
                However, their love story faced an unexpected obstacle. Anton's parents secured new job opportunities in Norway, forcing the couple to navigate the challenges of a long-distance relationship.
                Despite their best efforts, the strain proved too much, and they eventually parted ways. Nevertheless, the memory of their first love remained etched in their hearts, leaving a lasting impact
                on both of their lives.

                Sidon marked the beginning of Frida's second chapter in the world of relationships. She met Sidon while snorkeling, a chance encounter that led to a unique connection.
                His profound knowledge and passion for the ocean were captivating. Despite being a stranger, Sidon's extroverted nature led him to share the best snorkeling spots with Frida.
                She playfully dubbed him a "sea creature" due to his expertise in navigating the aquatic world. Their relationship was marked by a series of exciting adventures and fun activities.
                Frida was drawn to Sidon's optimistic outlook on life, and she appreciated his zest for living in the moment. However, as time passed, she started to find his unwavering optimism
                overwhelming and considered him too naive and unserious. Their differing life plans eventually led to their breakup.

                Nabooru, however, harbored aspirations that extended beyond staying in one place. She was committed to humanitarian work that often took her to distant places. Frida, in her unwavering
                support for Nabooru's dreams, faced the challenges of a relationship tested by geographical separation. Eventually, Nabooru reached a difficult decision. The demands of her humanitarian
                work made it impossible to maintain the relationship, and she chose to end it. The breakup left Frida deeply devastated and struggling to find her way forward.
